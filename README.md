# A Xamarin mobile application using Microsoft identity platform (formerly Azure AD v2.0)

[![Build status](https://identitydivision.visualstudio.com/IDDP/_apis/build/status/AAD%20Samples/.NET%20client%20samples/CI%20of%20Azure-Samples%20--%20xamarin-native-v2)](https://identitydivision.visualstudio.com/IDDP/_build/latest?definitionId=32)

## About this sample

### Scenario

You have a mobile application and you want it to consume Microsoft Graph or your own Web Api using **Microsoft Identity Platform** to acquire tokens.

### Structure of the repository

This repository contains a progressive tutorial made of two parts:

Sub folder                    | Description
----------------------------- | -----------
[1-Basic](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-xamarin-native-v2/tree/master/1-Basic) | This sample application shows how to use the Microsoft identity platform endpoint to sign-in a user interactively and display their profile </p> ![Topology](./1-Basic/ReadmeFiles/Topology.png)
[2-With-broker](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-xamarin-native-v2/tree/master/2-With-broker)  | This incremental chapter adds support for the broker (Microsoft Authenticator), enabling more scenarios like device related conditional access and SSO. **This chapter is only available for Xamarin.iOS for the moment, not Xamarin.Android yet** </p>  ![Topology](./2-With-broker/ReadmeFiles/Topology.png)

## How to run this sample

To run this sample, you'll need:

- [Visual Studio 2019](https://aka.ms/vsdownload). Install or update Visual Studio with the following workloads:
  - Universal Windows Platform Development
  - Mobile Development with .Net
  
  Then from the "Individual Components" tab, make sure these additional items are selected:
  - Android SDK setup (API level 27)
  - Windows 10 SDK (10.0.17134.0)
  - Android SDK level 27 (oreo) and 28 (pie), and Android SDK build tools 27.0.3 are also required. These are not installed through the VS Installer, so instead use the Android SDK Manager (Visual Studio > Tools > Android > Android SDK Managerâ€¦)
- An Internet connection
- A Windows machine (necessary if you want to run the app on Windows)
- An OS X machine (necessary if you want to run the app on Mac)
- A Linux machine (necessary if you want to run the app on Linux)
- An Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant. For more information on how to get an Azure AD tenant, see [How to get an Azure AD tenant](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-howto-tenant/)
- A user account in your Azure AD tenant. This sample will not work with a Microsoft account (formerly Windows Live account). Therefore, if you signed in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with a Microsoft account and have never created a user account in your directory before, you need to do that now.
- Setup [Xamarin.iOS for Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/ios/get-started/installation/windows/introduction-to-xamarin-ios-for-visual-studio) (if you want to run the iOS app)

### Step 1:  Clone or download this repository

From your shell or command line:

```Shell
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-xamarin-native-v2.git
```

or download and exact the repository .zip file.

> Given that the name of the sample is pretty long, and so are the name of the referenced NuGet packages, you might want to clone it in a folder close to the root of your hard drive, to avoid file size limitations on Windows.

Then navigate to the sub-folder of your choice, [1-Basic](./1-Basic) or [2-With-broker](./2-With-broker)
