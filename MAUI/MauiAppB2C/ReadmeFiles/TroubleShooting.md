## Troubleshooting

### Some projects don't load in Visual Studio

This might be because you have not installed all the required components from Visual Studio. You need to add the **.NET Mutli-platform App UI development** [workload](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/modify-visual-studio?view=vs-2022), in the Visual Studio Installer.

### The project you want is not built

you need to right click on the visual studio solution, choose **Configuration Properties** > **Configuration** and make sure that you check the projects and configuration you want to build (and deploy)
